ðŸŒŒ Exoplanet Habitability Prediction Using cGANs and XGBoost
This project focuses on improving the prediction and classification of potentially habitable exoplanets â€” a key aspect in the search for life beyond our solar system. Current challenges in this domain include imbalanced classes and data scarcity due to the vastness of space.

To address this, we integrated data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL), and applied an extended Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate realistic synthetic data. A custom XGBoost classifier was then used to improve prediction accuracy.

Key Outcomes:

Successfully generated high-quality synthetic astronomical data using cGANs.
Achieved 96% prediction accuracy in classifying potentially habitable exoplanets.
Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining GANs with machine learning for astronomical data analysis.
This research presents a novel approach that can significantly advance exoplanet habitability studies and inspire future interstellar exploration.
